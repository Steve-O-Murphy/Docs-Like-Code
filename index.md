# Quick Start

## About
I'm learning GitHub publishing on GitHub pages.

## What is docs-as-code?
Docs-as-code is an approach to writing and publishing documentation with the same tools and processes developers use to create code. 

## The developer approach

Developers do the following:
1. Author code.
2. Create some kind of executable.
3. Do unit tests.
4. Pass it off to QA for additional tests.
5. Publish the final version

## The tech writer approach

<details>
  <summary>Tech writers do the following:</summary>
  1. Author documentation and store it in a version control system. 

    _Over the last few years I've been using GitHub._
  
 2. Use some kind of static site generator (SSG) to generate HTML output. 
 3. FTP to a documentation site. The content could be hosted on your company's site or hosting provider such as Amazon.
