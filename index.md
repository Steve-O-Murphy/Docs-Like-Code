# Quick Start

## About
I'm learning GitHub publishing on GitHub pages.

**Note:** I like using the "down" style in headings.

## What is docs-as-code?
Docs-as-code is an approach to writing and publishing documentation with the same tools and processes developers use to create code. 

## The developer approach

Developers do the following:
1. Author code.
2. Create some kind of executable.
3. Do unit tests.
4. Push to GitHub.
5. Create PR with reviewers.
6. Do the edit/review/push cycle.
7. Merge the changes.

## The tech writer approach

It's much like the [developer appoach](#The-Developer-approach).

 4. Do the edit/revise/push cycle.
  
 5. Merge changes.
